# vehicle_detector

### Starting point:
    - dataset
        - collect images
        - scripts - utility scripts that I wrote for images.


### Notes:
    - dataset/raw - folder not commited - contains raw images
    - dataset/scripts/chromedriver - removed chromedriver
    - Delete invalid images
        - python invalid_images.py --dataset=imgs_directory
